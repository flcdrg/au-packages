    <description>Visual Studio extension for .NET developers
### Analyze code quality

On-the-fly code quality analysis is available in C#, VB.NET, XAML, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and XML. You'll know right away if your code needs to be improved.

### Eliminate errors and code smells

Not only does ReSharper warn you when there's a problem in your code but it provides hundreds of quick-fixes to solve problems automatically. In most cases, you can select the best quick-fix from a variety of options.

### Safely change the code base

Automated solution-wide code refactorings help safely change your code base. Whether you need to revitalize legacy code or put your project structure in order, you can lean on ReSharper.

### Instantly traverse the entire solution

You can instantly navigate and search in the whole solution. Jump to any file, type, or type member, or navigate from a specific symbol to its usages, base and derived symbols, or implementations.

### Enjoy code editing helpers

Multiple code editing helpers include extended IntelliSense, hundreds of instant code transformations, auto-importing namespaces, rearranging code and displaying documentation.

### Comply with coding standards

Code style and formatting functionality with fine-grained, language-specific settings will help you get rid of unused code and create a common coding standard for your team.
