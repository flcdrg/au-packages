### Operating System requirements for SQL Server Developer

- Windows 10 TH1 1507 or greater
- Windows Server 2016 or greater

### Package Specific

#### Package notes

This package will install SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition using an existing .iso file. If a path to an existing .iso is not supplied, it downloads the same .iso that can be obtained from the [SQL Server Basic Installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853016)'s *Download Media* menu.

The initial release of this package is focused on installing and uninstalling a default instance of SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition.

Future plans include better support for non-default instances (including uninstalling).

Note that the install script makes use of `Mount-DiskImage` as the minimum OS requirements for SQL Server include this cmdlet.

#### Package Parameters

The following package parameters can be set:

- `/IsoPath:` - path to a local copy of the .iso file - if not supplied then .iso is downloaded
- `/IgnorePendingReboot` - don't check for pending reboot (Warning, SQL Server installation may fail if reboots are pending)

All other package parameters are passed through to SQL Server Setup, allowing you to customise the installation as necessary.

The following are set by default:

- `/ConfigurationFile:` - The path to a configurationfile.ini - defaults to the supplied tools\configurationfile.ini
- `/SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS:` - A username or group to add to the SQL SysAdmin role - defaults to current user. This option is only set if configurationfile.ini does not contain 'SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS=' at the start of a line. 

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt#Install for the full list of parameters supported by SQL Server.

To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install sql-server-2019 [other options] --params="'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2'"`).

Example using /IsoPath to use previously downloaded SQL Server .iso

```powershell
choco install sql-server-2019 --params="'/IsoPath:c:\downloads\SQLServer2019-x64-ENU-Dev.iso'"
```

#### Chocolatey Pro / Business users

If you allow the package to download the ISO file, it is suggested you run Chocolatey with the `--skip-virus-check` parameter, as the online virus scanner doesn't handle files over 500MB. You should use alternate methods of scanning in this case.
