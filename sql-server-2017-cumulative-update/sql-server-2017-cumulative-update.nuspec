    <tags>SQL Server Cumulative Update 2017</tags>
    <summary>The latest Cumulative Update (CU) download is the most recent CU released for SQL Server 2017</summary>
    <description>The latest Cumulative Update (CU) download is the most recent CU released for SQL Server 2017 and contains all updates released since the release of SQL Server 2017 RTM.

- Each new CU contains all the fixes that were included in the previous CU for the installed version of SQL Server.
- SQL Server CUs are certified to the same levels as Service Packs, and should be installed at the same level of confidence.
- Microsoft recommends ongoing, proactive installation of CUs as they become available:
  - Historical data shows that a significant number of support cases involve an issue that has already been addressed in a released CU.
  - CUs may contain added value over and above hotfixes. This includes supportability, manageability, and reliability updates.
- We recommend that you test CUs before you deploy them to production environments.

#### Uninstalling
Uninstalling with Chocolatey is known to not be reliable, as the uninstaller wants to locate `sql_engine_core_inst_loc.msi` from the original installation media.

Should you need to uninstall this cumulative update, you may need to revert to manual uninstallation via Programs and Features, Installed Updates.
