    <summary>.NET Memory Profiler</summary>
    <description>dotMemory allows you to analyze memory usage in a variety of .NET and .NET Core applications: desktop applications, Windows services, ASP.NET web applications, IIS, IIS Express, arbitrary .NET processes, and more.

### Easily control profiling process

Use timeline view to monitor memory consumed by your application in real time. Collect info on allocations as you need it.

### Collect profiling data

Get snapshots with a single click without stopping your profiling session, add them to compare or browse memory traffic during a particular timeframe.

### Auto-detect issues

Thanks to multiple powerful built-in inspections, most common memory issues are detected with a single click, no manual effort required. Just get a snapshot and be guided to optimizing memory usage.

### Analyse deeper

For in-depth analysis, dotMemory offers many different criteria to apply to memory usage data, so you can view data from thousands of different angles, and drill-down, dice, slice or pivot as you wish.

### Determine traffic

Analyse memory traffic in a particular timeframe to know the cause of excessive allocations and garbage collections. Determine how objects were allocated and collected and what methods stay behind these allocations

#### Package Parameters

The following package parameters can be set:

 * `/PerMachine` - install machine-wide (instead of per-user)
