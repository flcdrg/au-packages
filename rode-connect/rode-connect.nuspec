### Package updates

Rode use a 'static' download URL such that when they release a new version it will break older Chocolatey packages. Sometimes this package needs to be manually updated as Rode change the layout of the .zip file for each release. 

If you notice the package isn't working please leave a comment, or even better submit a pull request in the [package source repository](https://github.com/flcdrg/au-packages/tree/master/rode-connect).
