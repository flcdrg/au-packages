    <summary>Windows Admin Center is a locally deployed, browser-based app for managing servers, clusters, hyper-converged infrastructure, and Windows 10 and 11 PCs</summary>
    <description>Windows Admin Center is a remote management tool for Windows Server running anywhere—physical, virtual, on-premises, in Azure, or in a hosted environment—at no extra cost.

Here are a few things you can use Windows Admin Center for:

- Simplify server management: Manage your servers and clusters with modernized versions of familiar tools such as Server Manager. Install in under five minutes and manage servers in your environment immediately, no extra configuration required. For details, see What is Windows Admin Center?
- Work with hybrid solutions: Integration with Azure helps you optionally connect your on-premises servers with relevant cloud services. For details, see Azure hybrid services.
- Streamline hyperconverged management: Streamline management of Azure Local or Windows Server hyperconverged clusters. Use simplified workloads to create and manage VMs, Storage Spaces Direct volumes, Software-Defined Networking and more. For details, see Manage HCI.

Once installed, you can access Windows Admin Center through a web browser by navigating to https://localhost:6516.
